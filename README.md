### Overview

![3D model](Images/CM5-STM32H7.jpg)

The MCU module uses a high performance STM32 MCU and is pin compatible with Raspberry Pi CM5. The MCU cannot generate an HDMI compatible signal, so a TI TFP410 is used to convert 24-bit RGB to HDMI compatible signal. Since the BB3+ offers dual display: a built-in 5" TFT touchscreen and an external monitor, a 1:2 high speed mux (TS3DV642) is used for destination selection.
